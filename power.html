        <p>Power (パワー Pawā?) was the tritagonist of the Public Safety Saga. She was the Blood Fiend (血ちの魔ま人じん Chi no Majin?) and a Public Safety Devil Hunter who was part of Makima's special squad.</p>
        <p>Power possesses the corpse of an unknown woman or girl with long hair. Her hair color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, even appearing dirty blonde or light brown in some official art, and appears strawberry blonde in the anime.</p>
        <p> As a Fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head.</p>
        <p>If Power accumulates too much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides of her head.</p>
