            Aki Hayakawa (早はや川かわ アキ Hayakawa Aki?) was the deuteragonist of the Public Safety Saga. 
            He was a Public Safety Devil Hunter working under Makima's special squad 
            who had contracts with the Curse Devil and Future Devil, and a former contract with the Fox Devil.

            During the Gun Devil arc, he was killed and possessed by 20% of the Gun Devil,
            thus becoming the host of the Gun Fiend (銃じゅうの魔ま人じん Jū no Majin?).
